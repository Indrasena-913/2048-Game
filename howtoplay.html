			<h1>Game Strategy and Tips</h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				2048 is a single-player puzzle game. The original idea was contributed
				in March 2014 by Gabriele Cirulli using an inspiration of the 1024 app
				game. The purpose of the game is to dictate a sequence of arrow
				movements on a 4x4 board with the purpose of reaching the 2048 value on
				the board. Each arrow movement:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					triggers numbers on the board to move in that direction should free
					space be available.
				</li>
				<li>
					merges two numbers of the same value into their sum when they are on
					consecutive positions aligned with the arrow's direction.
				</li>
				<li>triggers new values of 2 or 4 to appear randomly on the board.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				The game can be a bit frustrating for new players due to its simple
				rules and an easy start, which contrasts with the relative difficulty in
				the later game to reach a solution. In the following paragraphs we
				present a series of tips and tricks that should help shape a strategy
				for winning the game in the majority of the cases.
			</p>
			<h1>1. Have a corner</h1>
			<p>
				The 2048 game board hosts two main activities that are taking place all
				the time:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					the generation of new square values (that are always either a 2 or a
					4).
				</li>
				<li>the merging of values in order to create greater numbers.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				These 2 activities need to be organized in order to facilitate the
				process to take place incrementally. One way to do this is via a
				gradient, where you encourage the largest value of the board to be
				placed in one of its corners. All the other numbers would start
				initially at a distance from that corner, and then begin to close-in on
				it as they become bigger.
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
				You can obtain this gradient pattern by following a basic sequence
				movement, consisting of pressing two arrows alternatively, one on the
				vertical direction and the other one on the horizontal direction (for
				example, arrow-up and arrow-left will place the largest value in the
				left-top corner). You can follow this technique alone in order to reach
				easily a value of 128 or even higher. If you get stuck and neither of
				the two arrows is providing any valid moves, then move horizontally
				against the regular move (so do one arrow-right if you were doing
				arrow-lefts) and immediately after, do the regular vertical move. This
				should get the board unstuck and allow you to continue to play the game.
			</p>
			<h2>2. A full home row</h2>
			<p>
				If you play a few games just using the strategy above, you might observe
				one of its flaws: when stuck, the suggestion to move horizontally
				against the regular movement has often a side-effect in the sense of
				moving the highest value on the board towards the center of the row.
				This is dangerous as a new 2 or 4 number might appear in the corner that
				freed up, and this might make it impossible to restore the highest value
				into a corner. The best way to deal with this situation is to prevent
				it. Should you have the opportunity, you should always 'move' new values
				on the home row (depending on how you move, the first or the last row on
				the board containing the highest value in its corner) so that it's
				always full (4 numbers out of 4). This will ensure that you can reverse
				the direction horizontally without risking to move the highest value.

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>
				The strategies presented go a long way to enrich your 2048 skill-set and
				improve your abilities for solving this puzzle. We recommend to
				implement the suggestions via your own practice and develop your own
				style of playing the game based on them. If you want to practice the
